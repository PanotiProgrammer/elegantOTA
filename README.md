# ESP8266 OTA (Over-the-Air) Programming

This repository provides a basic example of implementing Over-the-Air (OTA) programming on the ESP8266 microcontroller. OTA allows developers to upload new firmware to their devices wirelessly, eliminating the need for physical connections during updates.

## Features

- **Wireless Firmware Updates:** Upload new sketches to the ESP8266 over Wi-Fi.
- **LED Blink Example:** Demonstrates OTA functionality by blinking an LED connected to GPIO2.

## Prerequisites

- **Hardware:** ESP8266 development board.
- **Software:** Arduino IDE with the ESP8266 board package installed.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp8266-ota-example.git
Open the ota_basic.ino sketch in the Arduino IDE.

Configure your Wi-Fi credentials:

Replace your_SSID and your_PASSWORD with your network's SSID and password:

cpp
Copy
const char* ssid = "your_SSID";
const char* password = "your_PASSWORD";
Upload the sketch via serial:

Connect your ESP8266 to the computer using a USB-to-serial adapter.

Select the appropriate board and port in the Arduino IDE.

Upload the sketch.

Perform OTA updates:

After the initial upload, the ESP8266 will connect to your Wi-Fi network.

In the Arduino IDE, navigate to Tools > Port and select the network port corresponding to your device (e.g., esp8266-[IP address]).

Upload subsequent sketches wirelessly.

Notes
Initial Serial Upload: The first firmware upload must be done via a serial connection to enable OTA functionality.

Sketch Size Limitation: Ensure that the compiled sketch size does not exceed 50% of the ESP8266's flash memory to accommodate OTA updates.

For more detailed information and advanced configurations, refer to the ESP8266 Arduino Core documentation.
